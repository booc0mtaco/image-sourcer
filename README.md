# image-sourcer

Image Sourcer is a browser plugin that can be used to
pull up a list of the images used on a page at a given
time. Useful for comparing assets without having to
dive into the browser console.


# Build

The build process is run thru a simple shell script, as
opposed to some amalgam of javascript libraries and modules.
It does use [NPM](http://npmjs.com/), though. You can build
the plugin with:

```
./build.sh
```
